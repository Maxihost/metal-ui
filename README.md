# Metal UI

A shared set of UI components using React.

## How to use

Install package:

`npm install @maxihost/metal-ui``

Import the component:

`import { Button } from '@maxihost/metal-ui';`

## How to develop

The development mode is running into Storybook, so you need to clone the project, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. The Storybook tab will open automatically in your browser.

After your changes are done, just need to run `npm run build` to update the dist folder.
